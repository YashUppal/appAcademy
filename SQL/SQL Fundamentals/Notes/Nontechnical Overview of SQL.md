# Nontechnical Overview of SQL

## SQL - Structured Query Language

* SQL is a tool used to store some data. Data is stored in form on tables in this case.

## NoSQL

* A tool similar to SQL but stores data in forms other than tables. It could be key-value pairs.

## Terminologies 

1) Transaction - One coherent action performed against the database. "All or nothing". Either the transaction(action) will go through successfully or it will be rolled back completely. No partial transactions

2) Query - A command performed on a database

3) Normalization - Concept of storing references to data which is stored in a different location, rather than storing the data itself in multiple locations. The concept to storing references to objects instead of objects.
