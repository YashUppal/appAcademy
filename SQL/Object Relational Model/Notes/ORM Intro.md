# Object Relational Mappers

## What is Object Relational Mappers?

* Object Relational Mappers are used to interact with a database directly using a language, instead of embedding SQL code in our program. Simply put, we can CREATE,READ,UPDATE,DELETE directly to our database using a single programming language (like Ruby), instead of writing SQL queries and embedding them in our program.
