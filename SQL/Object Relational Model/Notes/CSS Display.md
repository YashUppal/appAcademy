# CSS Display

## What's display property?

* It is a property you could give to an element that decides it's display behaviour. It has 5 values
1) Inline - Will make the element behave as an inline element, meaning it will stay inline and respect line height. If a padding property is provided, it will push things around it horizontally not vertically.

2) Block - Block elements will break on a new line, and take up as much horizontal space as possible.

3) Inline-Block - A combination of inline and block elements.

4) None - Hide

5) Flex - Make the container a flexbox one.
