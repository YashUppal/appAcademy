# CSS Box Model

## What is the CSS Box Model?

* Every element (tag) in a CSS Document can be imagined as a box. It has a ```margin```,```padding``` and a ```border``` around it. The padding is the space between the content and the border. The border is the line around the content. The margin is the private space an element needs around it.
