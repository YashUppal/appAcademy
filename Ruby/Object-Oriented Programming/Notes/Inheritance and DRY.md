# Inheritance and DRY

## Inheritance

* We can write classes that inherit from a single class, this will allow us to avoid code duplication. DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself, a rule that states we should avoid code duplication wherever possible.

## Overcomplicated Inheritance

* Do not un-necessarily use inheritance, this will only make the code more complicated.
