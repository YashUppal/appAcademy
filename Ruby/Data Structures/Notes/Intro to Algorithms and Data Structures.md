 # Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures

 ## Tree

 * A tree is a data-structure, which stores data in a 'tree-like' format having nodes with a parent-child relationship. A node might have any number of children, but in the case of a binary tree each node will have atmost 2 child nodes.

 ## Tree Traversal

 * Iterating the nodes in the tree

 ### DFS

 * DFS stands for Depth First Search and is a way of traversing a tree by diving to the leaf-nodes first. Prioritises searching throught the 'depths' of the tree first.

 ### BFS

 * BFS stands for Breadth First Search and is a way of treaversing a tree by going  layer (level) by layer. Prioritises searching throught the 'breadth' of the tree first

 ## Algorithm and Method

 * An algorithm is a idea, a step by step procedure that solves a problem. A method is an implementation of that idea in code. An algorithm could be implemented in any language.
