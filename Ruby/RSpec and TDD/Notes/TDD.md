# TDD (Test Driven Development)

## What is TDD?

* TDD stands for Test Driven Development and is a methodology for writing code that states tests should be written first, then code should be written to pass those test. The tests should drive the development of our program.

## Motivations for TDD

1) It ensures testable-code is written (since code is written to pass a test)
2) Developers will implement only the important features (enforce YAGNI - You ain't gonna need it)
3) Red, Green, Refactor ensures tight workflow

## Red, Green, Refactor

1) Write the tests, run them and see them fail (red)
2) Write the minimum amount of code to make sure the tests pass (green)
3) Refactor the code to make it cleaner (refactor)
