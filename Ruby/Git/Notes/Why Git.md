# Why Git?

## What is Git?

* A Version Control System, used to keep track of all versions of our code and allow collaboration between multiple developers.

## Three stages of git

1) Changes are made to our code in out **working directory**, the file is now **modified**
2) Add the modified files to our **staging area**
3) **Commit** the files on our **staging area** and create a new snapshot.
