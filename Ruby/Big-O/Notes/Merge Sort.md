# Merge Sort

## What is Merge Sort

* Merge Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses the idea of divide and conquer to sort some data. The data is recursively partitioned into two halfs until no further partitioning is possible, then the halves are sorted and joined to together until data is sorted.
