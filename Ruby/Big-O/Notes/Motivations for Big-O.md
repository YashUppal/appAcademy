# Motivations for Big-O

## What is Big-O used for?

* To determine if Algorithm A is better than Algorithm B. Better, in this context, will mean **faster**. Algorithm A is **faster** than Algorithm B.

## Factors that affect the algorithm

* Hardware - could be slower or faster

* Language Implementation - Execution speeds and runtime varies from language to langugage.

* Number of steps - How many things does the algorithm takes

* Input (size and type) - What is the size and type of input provided.
