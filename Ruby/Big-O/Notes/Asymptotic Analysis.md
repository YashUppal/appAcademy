# Asymptotic Analysis

## What is Asymptotic Analysis?

* Examining the behaviour and performance of an algorithm in terms of it input size. In mathematics, it refers to the behaviour of a line as it approaches its limits (or infinity)

## Idea behind

* Two major points to note:
1) Ignore the constants - Constants will get more and more insignificant as you increase the input
2) Most dominant term wins [ Only as fast as your bottleneck ] - The most dominant term will matter. Bottleneck is the slowest part of your algorithm.
