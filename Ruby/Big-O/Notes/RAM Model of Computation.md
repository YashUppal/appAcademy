# RAM Model of Computation

## What is RAM Model of Computation?

* RAM (Random Access Machine) model of computation refers to the model which is used to compute and calculate the runtime of an algorithm precisely, in terms of **time-steps** and algorithm takes. Simple operations like addition, subtraction take one time-step. Loops take as many time-steps as the time loop runs. Memory access takes exactly one step.
