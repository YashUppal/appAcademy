# Big O Classifications

## O(1) - Constant 

* The runtime is constant, is not affected by input. Example - Addition

## O(logn) - Logarithmic

* The runtime is logarithmic. Example - Binary Search

## O(n) - Linear

* The runtime is linear. Example - Linear Search

## O(N^2) - Quadratic

* Runtime is quadratic, example - Bubble Sort, Nested Loops

## O(nlog n) - Log Linear/ Super Linear

* Example - Merge Sort

## O(n!) - Factorial

* Runtime is factorial. Example - Permutations.
