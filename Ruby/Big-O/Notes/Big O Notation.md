# Big O Notation

## What is Big O Notation

* A way to measure the efficiency of an algorithm. How quickly the runtime grows relative to the input as the input gets arbitrarily large.

## Points to note

1) Ignore the constants
2) Ignore the less significant term
3) Consider the worst case
4) There is usually a tradeoff between space and time complexity.
