# Worst Case

## What is the worst case?

* Worst Case refers to the situation when an algorithm is performing under circumstances which will test it's performance when things are not under it's favor. Example would be, In Linear Search, the worst case would be when the element that we are looking for is the last element in the array.

## Why Worst Case?

* Worst Case scenarios are a good way to judge algorithms performance because rarely in real word will the situation be ideal for an algorithm, so it's impractical to judge performance in the fastest case.

## What is Big O

* Big O refers to the asymptotic worst case runtime of an algorithm.
