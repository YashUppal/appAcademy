# A number's summation is the sum of all positive numbers less than or equal to the number. For example: the summation of 3 is 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, the summation of 6 is 21 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21. Write a method summation_sequence that takes in a two numbers: start and length. The method should return an array containing length total elements. The first number of the sequence should be the start number. At any point, to generate the next element of the sequence we take the summation of the previous element. You can assume that length is not zero.

def summation_sequence(start, length)
  sequence = []
  length.times do
    sequence << start
    start = summation(start)
  end
  
  return sequence
end

def summation(num)
  sum = 0
  (1..num).each do |num|
    sum += num
  end
  return sum
end


print summation_sequence(3, 4) # => [3, 6, 21, 231]
puts
print summation_sequence(5, 3) # => [5, 15, 120]
