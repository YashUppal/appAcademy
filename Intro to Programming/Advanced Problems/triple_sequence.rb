# Write a method triple_sequence that takes in two numbers, start and length. The method should return an array representing a sequence that begins with start and is length elements long. In the sequence, every element should be 3 times the previous element. Assume that the length is at least 1.

def triple_sequence(start, length)
  sequence = []
  length.times do
    sequence << start
    start = start * 3
  end
  return sequence
end

print triple_sequence(2, 4) # => [2, 6, 18, 54]
puts
print triple_sequence(4, 5) # => [4, 12, 36, 108, 324]
